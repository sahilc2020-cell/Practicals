Aim Create a Student Record Management System using Linked List

Objective:
To implement a Student Record Management System using a linked list data structure that can 
perform basic operations such as Add, Delete, Update, Search, and Sort.
Course Outcome (CO):
Students will be able to design and implement data structures such as linked lists for managing 
real-world data efficiently.

Problem Statement:
Design and implement a program in Python that maintains a list of student records using a singly 
or doubly linked list. Each record should store the following details:
 Roll Number
 Name
 Marks
The system should perform operations like:
 Adding a new student record
 Deleting an existing student record
 Updating student details
 Searching a record by roll number or name
 Sorting records based on Roll Number or Marks (ascending/descending order)
 Displaying all student records

Theory:
A linked list is a linear data structure in which elements (nodes) are connected using pointers. 
Each node contains:
1. Data — actual information (e.g., student details).
2. Link/Pointer — address/reference to the next node.
Types of Linked Lists:
1. Singly Linked List: Each node contains data and a pointer to the next node.

Conclusion:
The Student Record Management System using linked list was successfully implemented. 
Various operations like Add, Delete, Update, Search, and Sort were performed efficiently 
using the linked list data structure.
