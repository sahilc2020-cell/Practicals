AIM : Searching Techniques

OBJECTIVE
 To understand different searching techniques.
PROBLEM STATEMENT :
In an e-commerce system, customer account IDs are stored in a list, and you are tasked with
writing a program that implements the following:
• Linear Search: Check if a particular customer account ID exists in the list.
• Binary Search: Implement Binary search to find if a customer account ID exists, improving 
the search efficiency over the basic linear.

OUTCOME
Analyze basic searching algorithms to solve problems and evaluate their efficiency in 
different scenarios

THEORY 
Searching Techniques : 
Searching is the process of finding a given value position in a list of values. It decides
whether a search key is present in the data or not. It is the algorithmic process of finding a 
particular item in a collection of items.
Different Searching techniques are,
 Linear Search
 Binary Search
 Fibonacci Search
1. Linear Search: a linear search or sequential search is a method for finding an element 
within a list. It sequentially checks each element of the list until a match is found or the 
whole list has been searched. Time Complexity is O(n).

CONCLUSION 
Thus we have implemented linear search and binary search technique and analyzed 
the results for best, worst and average cases.
