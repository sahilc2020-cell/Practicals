1. Aim: Implementation of Real-Time Undo/Redo System for a Text Editing 
Application using Stack Data Structure

2. Objective:
To design and implement a simple text editing application that supports:
 Making changes
 Undoing the most recent change
 Redoing an undone change
 Displaying the current state of the document using the Stack data structure.

3. Problem Statement:
Implementing a real-time undo/redo system for a text editing application using a Stack data 
structure. The system should support the following operations: 
1. Make a Change: A new change to the document is made. 
2. Undo Action: Revert the most recent change and store it for potential redo. 
3. Redo Action: Reapply the most recently undone action. 
4. Display Document State: Show the current state of the document after undoing or 
redoing an action

4. Outcome: Analyze Stack Data Structure for various operations like Push And Pop to 
perform Undo and Redo functions.

5. Theory:
A Stack is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are 
performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last 
Out). LIFO implies that the element that is inserted last, comes out first and FILO implies that 
the element that is inserted first, comes out last.
Basic operations we can do on a stack are:
 Push: Adds a new element on the stack.
 Pop: Removes and returns the top element from the stack.
 Peek: Returns the top element on the stack.
 isEmpty: Checks if the stack is empty.

8. Conclusion:
 The experiment successfully demonstrates how the stack data structure can be used to 
implement an efficient Undo/Redo system in a text editor. 
 Using two stacks (Undo and Redo), the system can revert and reapply changes while 
maintaining a proper history of edits.
 Size: Finds the number of elements in the stack.
