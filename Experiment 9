Title: Implement Various Operations on a Binary Search Tree (BST) such as Insertion, 
Deletion, Display, and Search

Objective: To implement and perform basic operations on a Binary Search Tree (BST)
such as Insertion, Deletion, Display (Traversal), and Search using Python.

Course Outcome (CO): Students will be able to construct and manipulate a Binary 
Search Tree and perform standard operations such as insertion, deletion, and searching 
efficiently.

Problem Statement: Design and implement a program in Python to perform various 
operations on a Binary Search Tree (BST).
The operations to be implemented are:
1. Insertion of nodes
2. Deletion of nodes
3. Search for a given value
4. Display the tree using Inorder, Preorder, and Postorder traversals

Theory: Binary Search Tree (BST):
A Binary Search Tree is a non-linear data structure that stores elements (called nodes) in a 
hierarchical manner.
Each node contains:
 A data value
 A left child
 A right child
BST Property:
For any node N in the BST:
 All nodes in the left subtree have values less than N.
 All nodes in the right subtree have values greater than N.
Operations on BST:
1. Insertion:
o Start from the root.
o If the new value is less than the root, move to the left subtree; else move to the 
right subtree.

Conclusion: The program successfully implements all the major operations on a Binary 
Search Tree, including insertion, search, deletion, and display (traversal).
The BST maintains sorted order, and traversal methods confirm proper tree structure.

Result: A Binary Search Tree was successfully constructed, and the operations (insert, 
search, delete, display) were performed correctly with expected results.
