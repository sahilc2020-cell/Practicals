Experiment No. 1
1. Aim:
To write a Python program to manage borrowing records of books in a library and perform 
operations such as computing average borrowings, identifying books with highest/lowest 
borrowings, counting members with zero borrowings, and finding the most frequently borrowed 
book.

2. Objective:
 To manage book borrowing data using Python dictionaries.
 To compute key metrics such as average borrowings and borrowing trends.
 To practice statistical and analytical operations on real-world datasets.
 To analyze time and space complexity of basic data operations.

3. Problem Statement:
Write a Python program to manage the borrowing records of books in a library. Implement the 
following functionalities:
1. Compute the average number of books borrowed by all library members.
2. Find the book with the highest and lowest number of borrowings.
3. Count the number of members who have not borrowed any books (i.e., borrow count is 
0).
4. Display the most frequently borrowed book (mode of borrow counts).
5. Determine the time and space complexity of each operation.

4. Outcome: Analyze list, library data structure for various operations like, insert data, count 
total list input.

5. Theory:
A library management system helps to keep track of the usage of library resources. This lab 
focuses on performing simple analysis over a dictionary-based dataset where:
 Keys = Book titles or Member names.
 Values = Borrow count.
Key concepts used:
 Dictionary Traversal
 List Comprehension
 Built-in statistical operations (statistics, collections.Counter)
 Time and space complexity analysis

8. Conclusion:
 This lab demonstrated how Python dictionaries and built-in libraries can be used to 
analyze library data.
 Efficient use of list comprehension and dictionary operations enabled us to implement 
real-world scenarios with ease.
 Understanding time and space complexity helps optimize future applications
