AIM : Sorting Techniques

OBJECTIVE
 To understand different sorting techniques.
PROBLEM STATEMENT :
In a company, employee salaries are stored in a list as floating-point numbers. Write a Python 
program that sorts the employee salaries in ascending order using the following two
algorithms:
• Selection Sort: Sort the salaries using the selection sort algorithm.
• Bubble Sort: Sort the salaries using the bubble sort algorithm.
After sorting the salaries, the program should display top five highest salaries in the company

OUTCOME
Analyze basic sorting algorithms to solve problems and evaluate their efficiency in different 
scenarios

THEORY 
Sorting Techniques : 
It is the process of arranging or ordering information in the ascending or descending order of 
the key values.
There are many different techniques available for sorting, differentiated by their efficiency 
and space requirements. Following are some sorting techniques :
 Bubble Sort
 Selection Sort
 Insertion Sort
 Quick Sort
 Merge Sort

CONCLUSION 
Thus we have implemented Bubble sort and selection sort technique and analyzed the results 
for best, worst and average cases.
