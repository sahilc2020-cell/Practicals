Title:
Graph Traversal using BFS and DFS

Objective:
To represent a given graph using an Adjacency Matrix and Adjacency List, and to perform 
Breadth First Search (BFS) and Depth First Search (DFS) traversals starting from a given 
node.

Course Outcome (CO):
Students will be able to represent graphs using adjacency matrix and adjacency list, and 
implement traversal algorithms such as BFS and DFS effectively.

Problem Statement:
Consider a particular area in your city and identify some popular locations, say A, B, C, D, E.
Each location represents a node in a graph, and routes between two locations represent edges.
 Represent the graph using:
1. Adjacency Matrix (for DFS traversal)
2. Adjacency List (for BFS traversal)
 Starting from location A, perform:
o (i) Breadth First Search (BFS)
o (ii) Depth First Search (DFS)
 Display the order in which locations are visited.

Theory:
Graph:
A graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes (vertices) and edges (connections).
A graph can be represented as:
 G = (V, E), where
o V = set of vertices (locations)
o E = set of edges (routes between locations)

Conclusion:
The graph was successfully represented using both Adjacency Matrix and Adjacency List.
The traversal of the graph using BFS (Queue) and DFS (Recursion) was implemented 
successfully, providing correct visiting sequences of all nodes.

Result:
The BFS and DFS traversal algorithms were successfully implemented on a graph representing 
real-world locations using adjacency matrix and adjacency list representations.
